Regression Model to predict Success Index of Second-Generation Immigrants in the US

Please download the original dataset in this repo. No need to download 3 csv files as you can recreate yourself by running the code. However if you don't have time, you can download directly from this repo and skip running "data-cleaning.R" file.

Run the "data-cleaning.R" file find to get final clean datasets for visualizing and training the data

Run the "data-analysis.R" file for visualization of the dataset and PCA analysis, as well as models training (4 models will be trained here, including basic linear regression LM, LASSO, GAM and PCR). Disclaimer: the GAM model will take time to finish the training, the code is bug-free so please be patient. 

To view graphs in our presentation/paper, open the html files. In order to recreate these graphs, please run the R markdown files (also available in this repo). 

The file "ProgressReport.Rmd" is just for grading purpose of our data science class, it doesn't have anything to do with our final code and paper.
